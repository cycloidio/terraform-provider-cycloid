# cycloid_organization (Resource)

[Cycloid organizations](https://docs.cycloid.io/reference/organizations/) are highest entity level below the user in cycloid.

Everything that you will create will be done within an organization: credentials, teams, projects, etc.
A user can exist without one, but s/he will not be able to perform any actions if s/he is not part of at least one organization.

**
Warning: When creating a child organization, you will have to attach a subscription to it.
Unfortunately, that process can't be made using the API.
See [this documentation on how to manage it](https://docs.cycloid.io/reference/organizations/concepts/licencing#managed-service-provider-msp-context)
**

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cycloid_organization" "tf_organization" {
  name = "tforganization"
  organization_canonical = var.cycloid_organization
}

provider "cycloid" {
  url                    = var.cycloid_api_url
  jwt                    = var.cycloid_api_key
  organization_canonical = var.cycloid_organization
}

terraform {
  required_providers {
    cycloid = {
